# Uncovering Hidden Patterns: PCA and K-Means on Mall Customers Dataset #

This notebook applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to uncover hidden patterns in the Mall Customers Dataset. We will explore how dimensionality reduction can improve clustering performance and help in discovering meaningful customer segments.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess and normalize the data
- Apply K-means clustering on the original data
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality
- Apply K-means clustering on PCA-reduced data
- Compare clustering results and draw business insights
